&lt;p&gt;The last year (to be more precise the last 9 months), I served my compulsory military service. Unfortunately I didn't have much free time, so I tried to stay updated and contribute in Mozilla as far as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last month of my service, I was informed that a &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Buddy_Up_Pilot"&gt;QA pilot program&lt;/a&gt; was about to start. I had already before participated in test days, bug triaging and other QA activities and I thought that this program would help me to leverage my current knowledge and to get more experienced in QA tools and procedures. This was why I applied for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled I was among the people that have been selected to participate in this pilot program. This pilot program is about learning the tools and the procedures that QA team uses and use them to help &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Projects/BuddyUp"&gt;BuddyUp team&lt;/a&gt; to create a great app that will help many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How it started&lt;/h3&gt;
