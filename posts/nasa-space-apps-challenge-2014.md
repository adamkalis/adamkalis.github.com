The Greek Mozilla Community was there for Mozilla, participating and sponsoring the event. It was a great opportunity to talk and inform people for what is Mozilla and its mission and how they can be involved in Mozilla. Also, we helped participants that had questions or were unaware about web technologies and how they can use them to solve some of the challenges.
