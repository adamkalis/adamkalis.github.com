On Saturday 27 April 2013 was the first [meet-up of the Greek Mozilla community](https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozilla-greece-meetup/) in [hackerspace.gr](https://hackerspace.gr). In this meet-up we discussed about the latest news on the Mozilla universe, we analyzed our past activities and we set new goals for the next year.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

We started with a sort introduction about ourselves and what each of us do in Mozilla. Then we dived into Mozilla news and especially around Firefox OS and Webmaker projects and how we can get more involved in these projects.

After that we had a great discussion around the Greek community and how we can engage more people. We had also some mini presentations and talks and finally went out for a great dinner.

You can find more information by checking our agenda and notes in this [pad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/remo-greece-meetup-spring-2013).

I had a great time meeting new and old contributors and I will be happy to see them again soon.
